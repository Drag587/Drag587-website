            <p><h2>First of all, a Gas Cooker has four stove controllers with one extra for the oven. If you want to get it to work, you first need to connect a pipe it to your gas cylinder and you also need to connet a cord to your socket. Then you need to use a lighter or matches to light it. To make the fire come on, you turn the gas controller on then you use the lighter to put the fire then you control it.</h2></p>
